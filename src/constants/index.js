    question: "What is Holdspace?",
    answer: "Holdspace is an online presentation tool that keeps you visible while your slides and visuals appear beside you. It runs in your browser and lets you present with natural hand gestures instead of screen-sharing."
  },
  {
    question: "How does it work?",
    answer: "Holdspace uses your webcam and computer vision to recognize simple hand gestures. You can move between slides, bring up visuals, and highlight key points without touching your keyboard or mouse."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need special equipment?",
    answer: "No special equipment is needed. Holdspace works with your regular webcam and internet connection. You do not need a VR headset or any external sensors."
  },
  {
    question: "Is it compatible with my platform?",
    answer: "Yes. Holdspace works with Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and other video-conferencing platforms. You can share your Holdspace window or use it as a virtual camera so everyone sees your interactive overlay."
  },
  {
    question: "When will it be available?",
    answer: "Holdspace is currently in private beta. You can join the waitlist on our website to get early access and be the first to try new features when we launch publicly later this year."
